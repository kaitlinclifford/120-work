# HW-3 Response: Introduction

This week started out really great. When I saw the possiblities that coding can create from the p5 "Hello" video , I was really excited about starting to use p5 in order to see what I could make. Then things went terribly wrong when I couldn't figure out how to properly upload to the github repo. But after some really good help from Jon Swallow, I was able to figure it out and complete the homework assignment.

## Problems

So I didn't have many problems this week until I tried to upload to the github repo. Everything was going so well, but I don't know why I just can't figure out how to upload to the github repo. I got some helpful tips from Jon such as:

- only delete from my repository on my machine
- There is a way you can view your changes if you lost any work. At the toolbar on top of Github desktop app click view then history. You should see a history of your changes. Click on the change you want to recover and it will come up I would then copy and paste this back into the appropriate file.

When I have time I will go back to the repo and check everything out, and use these and the other tips he gave me to really understand what I was doing wrong.

## Progress

After having to redo all of the homework again, I was **hopefully** able to figure out what I was doing wrong, and **hopefully** uploaded it correctly. Everything seems so easy until you do one thing wrong.

## Overall Thoughts

Overall, this week wasn't too bad. I think that if I started doing this homework earlier than Tuesday, I would be able to not stress so much about the homework. Also, I'm glad that we have the issues page so that I can see other's issues as well as mine to try and help me figure out my problems.
